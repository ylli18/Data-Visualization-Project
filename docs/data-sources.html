<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 2</span> Data sources</h1>
<p>Since the Chinese government does not disclose detailed Chinese foreign investment data, studying Chinese foreign investment would rely on independent databases. In this study, we will mainly use two sources for Chinese foreign investment. One is the China Global Investment Tracker (CGIT) from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI). The other is the Global Chinese Official Finance Dataset from the AidData Lab at the College of William &amp; Mary.</p>
<p>CGIT follows Chinese global activities the way the Chinese government does. China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) publishes monthly data on Chinese outward investment and China’s total foreign contractual project value, two separate types of China’s development finance. In similar ways, CGIT tracks them separately and together as “investment” and “construction” projects. Being able to compare its total value to the regularly updated MOFCOM data, CGIT helps researchers understand how well it follows the official figure. So far, the Tracker has managed to retain a small gap from the official aggregate data published by the Chinese government.</p>
<p>The Geocoded Global Chinese Official Finance Dataset includes five datasets: one on China’s Official Development Assistance (ODA)-like projects, one on China’s Other Official Flows (OOF)-like projects, one on projects that are neither ODA-like nor OOF-like, one combining them all, and one with detailed project descriptions and sources for all projects. ODA and OOF are OECD countries definition. ODAs are traditionally referred as aids, whereas OOF are just investment. Since Chinese aids and investment do not use such a standard, researchers at AidData have to discern which are which by themselves so that the data could be comparable to western investment and aids.</p>
<p>Understanding the pros and cons of two datasets, we will use the investment information from CGIT, which covers the period from 2005 to 2019, and the text data from AidData’s data, which covers the period from 2005 to 2014.</p>

Mauritanian Health Minister Cheikh Ould Horma signed a two-year renewable convention on the health assistance with Chinese Ambassador to Mauritania Zhang Xun. The health-care personnel will assist local doctors in the hospitals of the capital city, Nouakchott, eastern Kiffa and Selibaby on the River Senegal, as well as in research centres. The 29th medical team left China in July 2010. The duration of stay is estimated about 2 years.","In 2008, China's Exim Bank provided a 2 billion yuan loan to Mauritania for a 900 meter extension of the Nouakchott Port, also known as the Port of Friendship (PANPA). The port will be built by China Communications Construction Company Ltd., and should be completed within 36 months. The loan has a 2 percent interest rate, with a 20 year maturity period and a 5 year grace period. The project includes the construction of a petroleum berth, a water break point, and a 5 km dyke along the port in order to accommodate 4 ships at a time, in order to increase total trade volume to the port. The project commenced in January of 2009, launched by Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz and Chinese vice foreign minister, Zhai Jun.","In May 2001, a Chinese economic and trade delegation signed economic accords on cooperation and debt reduction with the Angolan government during a three-day visit to Luanda. The Chinese government extended an interest-free line of credit totaling about $6 million. Angola's Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, George Chicoty, signed the agreements with China's Vice Minister of External Trade and Economic Cooperation, Zhang Xiang. This line of credit provided the funds for Luanda's Central Hospital in Kilamba Kiaxi and the 8 million USD contract was awarded to China Overseas Engineering Group. Construction started in July 2004 and was completed in 15 months. The hospital was inaugurated in February 2006. A Deborah Brautigam China in Africa blogpost from April 21, 2011, stated that 'The decision to build the 100-bed $8 million Luanda General Hospital was made in 2002, and after tenders in China, COVEC won the bid and constructed the building between July 2004 and February 2006.' Moreover, after cracks developed in the walls of the hospital in 2010, Brautigam wrote that officials from China and Angola met for several rounds of talks. 'The Chinese side will build some temporary wards and sewage systems for patients to ensure the operation of the hospital. Then the maintenance work and expansion of the hospital will begin.' The Chinese government will finance the new construction.' Today the hospital can accommodate 100 patients and offers services in laryngology, dermatology, neurology, opthalmology and physiotherapy. Reports in 2011 (Macao Magazine, correspondence with Chinese Ambassador to Angola) confirm that Luanda Hospital contains an anti-malaria center - China also contributed funds for the construction of the center and in 2009, it provided additional equipment (financial amount undisclosed) for the maintenance of the center and anti-malaria drugs for Angola's anti-malaria campaign. China Overseas Engineering was criticized for the poor quality of construction of the General Hospital.
