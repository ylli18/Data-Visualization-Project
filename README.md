# Data-Visualization-Project
Chinese foreign investment has skyrocketed since early this century. 
We are interested in learning trends and characteristics of Chinese foreign investment using project level data, which can also be combined into country-year level data.

This is a hosted, interactive display of data visualization using R. We performed static images based on ggplot2, maps using geospatial data, visualizations of text analyses, and network visualizations.
